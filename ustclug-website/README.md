# [ibugone/ustclug-website](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/ibugone/ustclug-website)

## Preparations

Grab a copy of `@fortawesome/fontawesome-pro` into `files/var/www/fontawesome` and delete everything **except** `css/`, `js/` and `webfonts/`. Then use `docker build`.

If you don't have access to that, you can also use iBug-packed `fapro-free` on NPM.
